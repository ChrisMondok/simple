simple
======

A simple javascript test framework, built for programmers.

Building
========

To build Simple, run `make`. To remove Simple.js, run `make clean`.

Writing Tests
=============

Writing tests is easy. Take a look in the examples folder, the examples should be perfectly clear. Do note that the
examples reference the indivual scripts, and not the "compiled" simple library. 

Testing Simple
==============

The tests folder contains a basic web page that tests the simple framework.
